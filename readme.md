Files related to my undergraduate dissertation at the University of Stirling.

## Data files

Exp1.csv - data from experiment 1.

Exp2.csv - data from experiment 2/3.

Exp2_effective_f.csv - data from experiment 2/3 but day has been converted to feeding day instead of chronological day.

## Scripts

Plots.R produces all plots.

Analysis.R is a recorded (but edited down) version of the steps taken for model selection and data analysis.

## Model Outputs

Model summaries are stored as formatted .html tables in the model_summaries folder. They are produced using sjPlot.

## Figures

Figures are stored in the figs folder. They are not in their complete state, as they are further modified in GIMP to aid in visual clarity, but all plotting is done in R.
